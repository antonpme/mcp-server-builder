## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Project Setup → Basic Extension Framework → OpenAI API Integration
2. Natural Language Processing → Code Generation Engine → MCP Protocol Implementation
3. User Interface Development → Template System → Python Language Support
4. Testing and Validation → Integration and Polish → Testing and Quality Assurance

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- UI development can proceed alongside core functionality
- Template system can be developed in parallel with Python support
- Testing framework can be implemented while core features are being developed
- Documentation can be created throughout the development process
