# MCP Server Builder - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
The MCP Server Builder is a VS Code extension that enables developers to create Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through natural language descriptions. By leveraging AI capabilities powered by OpenAI's GPT models, the tool will generate customizable, production-ready MCP server code that can be directly integrated into development workflows.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
