# MCP Server Builder — Implementation Summary

## Status
- Phase 1 complete (scaffolding, config, commands, basic UI, CI).
- Phase 2 foundations in place (OpenAI path + offline fallback, tests, packaging).  
  Remaining: MCP SDK wiring, preview wizard, robust error handling.

## What Exists Today
- Extension lifecycle, command registration, and SecretStorage for API keys.
- OpenAIService for generation requests; fallback generator if API key missing or request fails.
- Generation pipeline that parses JSON-in-markdown responses and writes files.
- Unit tests (OpenAI service + fallback), CI that tests on Node 16/18 and packages on Node 20.
- `.vscodeignore` tuned so VSIX contains compiled `out/**` only.

## What We Are Building Next
- MCP SDK integration (stdio/SSE) and richer templates (basic/tools/resources/prompts/advanced).
- Wizard with file‑tree preview and validation before writing.
- Provider abstraction that supports OpenAI, Google Gemini, Claude, and OpenRouter with shared retries/timeouts and friendly errors.
- Integration tests that compile and smoke‑run a generated TS server; minimal UI smoke tests.
- Public README with screenshots and troubleshooting; internal docs moved to a private repo and synced when authorized.

## Acceptance Criteria (Release)
- “Describe → Options → Preview → Generate” flow produces a runnable server with one real tool.
- Offline mode generates a useful scaffold with next‑steps.
- Tests and coverage gate pass in CI; VSIX packages cleanly.
- Docs are complete for end users; internal docs remain private and synced.
