## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Project Setup → Basic Extension Framework → OpenAI API Integration
2. Natural Language Processing → Code Generation Engine → MCP Protocol Implementation
3. User Interface Development → Template System → Python Language Support
4. Testing and Validation → Integration and Polish → Testing and Quality Assurance

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- UI enhancements can continue alongside backend improvements
- Template work can progress in parallel with Python support
- Testing infrastructure can evolve while new features land
- Documentation can be updated incrementally each phase

## Risk Mitigation
- **OpenAI API limitations:** provide graceful fallbacks and clear messaging
- **MCP SDK changes:** maintain abstraction layer between generator and SDK
- **VS Code API limitations:** verify across stable and insiders releases
- **Performance issues:** monitor latency, cache repeat operations, keep fallback ready
- **Timeline risk:** deliver in feature slices to keep scope manageable

## Success Metrics
- **Development:** >80% coverage target, lint/test automation green, response time SLAs met
- **Product:** Successful project generations, user retention, feedback sentiment, install volume
