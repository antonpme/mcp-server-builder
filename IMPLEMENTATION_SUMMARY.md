- ✅ Set up testing framework (Jest)
- ✅ Created CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Set up project documentation structure

### 2. Extension Framework
- ✅ Implemented VS Code extension activation and deactivation
- ✅ Created basic extension command registration
- ✅ Set up extension configuration settings
- ✅ Implemented basic UI components (webview panel)
- ✅ Created extension packaging and distribution configuration

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Configuration Management
- OpenAI API key configuration with secure storage
- Default language selection (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python)
- Default transport type selection (stdio, SSE)
- User-friendly prompts for missing configuration

### 2. Command System
- `mcp-server-builder.createServer`: Creates a new MCP server
- `mcp-server-builder.openWebview`: Opens the main webview panel
- Proper command registration and disposal

### 3. User Interface
- Webview-based UI with VS Code theming
- Form inputs for server description, language, and transport
- Progress notifications during server generation
- Responsive design with VS Code integration

### 4. Extension Lifecycle
- Proper activation and deactivation
- Welcome message on first activation
- State management for user preferences
- Error handling and user feedback

## Technical Implementation

### 1. TypeScript Configuration
- Strict type checking enabled
- Proper module resolution
- Source map generation for debugging
- DOM library support for webview

### 2. Build Pipeline
- TypeScript compilation to JavaScript
- ESLint for code quality
- Prettier for code formatting
- VSIX packaging for distribution

### 3. Testing Framework
- Jest for unit testing
- Mocha for VS Code extension testing
- Test configuration and setup
- Mock implementations for testing

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Multi-node version testing (16.x, 18.x)
- Linting and compilation checks
- Extension packaging and artifact upload

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

The foundation is now complete. The next phase will focus on:

1. OpenAI API Integration
   - Implement actual code generation
   - Add prompt engineering
   - Handle API responses and errors

2. Code Generation Engine
   - Implement template system
   - Add code validation
   - Support dependency management

3. MCP Protocol Implementation
   - Integrate MCP SDK
   - Generate tools and resources
   - Support different transport types

4. Advanced UI Features
   - Code editor integration
   - File explorer for generated projects
   - Real-time preview functionality

## Installation and Usage

1. Install the extension from the generated VSIX file
2. Configure your OpenAI API key in extension settings
3. Run the "Open MCP Server Builder" command
4. Describe your desired MCP server functionality
5. Select language and transport type
6. Generate and customize your MCP server

## Documentation Updates

All project documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the implementation:

- ✅ README.md - Updated with current features and installation instructions
- ✅ DESIGN.md - Refined with implementation details
- ✅ PRD.md - Adjusted to reflect completed Phase 1 requirements
- ✅ TASKS.md - Marked all Phase 1 tasks as complete
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md - Added comprehensive log of all changes
- ✅ STACK.md - Documented all technologies used
